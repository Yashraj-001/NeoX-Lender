## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (optional for local blockchain testing)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the platform

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashraj-001/NeoX-Lender.git
   cd NeoX-Lender
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy the contracts:

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network <network-name>
   ```

   Replace `<network-name>` with the appropriate network (e.g., `development`, `mainnet`, etc.).

5. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Smart Contracts

### Key Contracts

- **Lender.sol**: Core contract managing lending and borrowing.
- **Token.sol**: Implements the token standard for interacting assets.

---

## Usage

### Interacting with Contracts

1. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy contracts using the migration script provided in the `scripts/deploy.js`.
2. **Interact with the Contract**: Use the following script to interact with the deployed contract.

   ```bash
   node scripts/interact.js
   ```

   You can also interact directly via your wallet (MetaMask) after deploying on a live network.

---

## Testing

To run tests for the smart contracts:

1. Run the following command to execute the unit tests:

   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

2. For frontend testing, you can use:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
